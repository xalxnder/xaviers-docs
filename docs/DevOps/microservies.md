# Monoliths 
A monolith architecture is one where an entire application is deployed as a single unit. For example, in a Java web based app, it will be a **WAR** file. Based on the business requirements, this WAR file will have the code for shopping cart management, sales, inventory management, authentication etc... As you can see, this will most likely turn into a mess.


# Microservices

Self contained components or subsystem. They can live on their own, communicate with each other, and be deployed on their own.
