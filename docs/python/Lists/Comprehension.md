List Comprehension

```python
numbers = []
for x in range(3):
	numbers.append(x)
```

```python
numbers = [x for x in range(3)]
```

To make this easier on myself, I just read it out, starting from the for keyword. This is the beginning of the foor loop, and that first variable(x) is what we would be printing or doeing something with if this was a normal `for loop`.
