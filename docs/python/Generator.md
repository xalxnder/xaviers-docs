A generator expression is similar to a list comprehension, but it produces values lazily as they are needed, rather than creating an entire list in memory. This can be more memory efficient, especially when dealing with large datasets.

In Python, a generator expression is defined within parentheses `()` rather than square brackets `[]` used for list comprehensions. Here's the general syntax:

```python
(expression for item in iterable if condition)
```


```python
test_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]

doubled_generator = (x * 2 for x in test_list)

for doubled_value in doubled_generator:        print(doubled_value)

>> 2 4 6 8 10 12 14 16 18 20


```



When you access a key directly in a dictionary using square brackets (`[]`), it raises a `KeyError` if the key doesn't exist in the dictionary. However, using the `get()` method allows you to provide a default value that will be returned if the key is not found, thus avoiding the `KeyError`
