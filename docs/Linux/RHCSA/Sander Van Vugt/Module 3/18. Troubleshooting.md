# Changing The Root Password
1. ctrl + e
2. In linux add `init=/bin/bash` at the end of the line. 
3. ctrl + x
4. mount -o remount,rw /
5. passwd
6. touch /.autorelabel
7. exec /usr/lib/systemd/systemd


# Filesystem Problems 
Since you'll be editing fstab a lot, you might make a typo. A dead giveaway is after rebooting, you see the message `Give root password for maintenance` To fix:
- After you enter the root password, you can edit /etc/fstab, and see what the problem is.  
- Remount filesystem in read/write state and edit /etc/fstab

If you mess up the root filesystem name in fstab, no biggie. Why? Because it's already listed as an argument of the linux kernel in the grub menu. 

>[!TIP] It's better to avoid problems, so you should just run `mount -a` whenever editing fstab.


# Network Issue
Some common scenarios are:
- Wrong subnet mask
- Wrong router
- DNS not working

- Use ip a to check the IP addresses.

	- We can see the following IP is missing a subnet mask
	- `ip a d 192.168.4.235/32 dev ens`
	- `ip a a dev ens33 192.168.4.235/24`

But now when we ping, we get a `Network is unreachable` error. This is indicative of a router issue. So lets check the routing table with `ip route show`
![[Pasted image 20220823064737.png|800]]

Looks like we're missing a default route. Add one with `ip route add default via 192.168.4.2` 
The original ping command should be working now. Make sure these settings stay persistent by adding them with nmtui.
