# Systemd Targets
A Systemd target is basically just a group of **units** that belong together. Isolatable targets contain everything a system needs to boot or change its current state.

### Working With Targets
Working with targets comes down to 3 common tasks:
-   Adding units to be automatically started
-   Setting a default target
-   Running a non-default target to enter troubleshooting mode

### Target Units
Behind a target there is some configuration. This configuration consists of two parts:

-   The target unit file
-   The “wants” directory, which contains references to all unit files that need to be loaded when entering a specific target

### Isolating Targets
By isolating a target, you start that target with all of its dependencies. Only targets that have the isolate option enabled can be isolated.  To isolate a target, use the `systemctl isolate` command. The following targets can be isolated:

- poweroff.target
- rescue.target
- multi-user.target 
- graphical.target 
- reboot.target

### Setting the Default Target
Type `systemctl get-default` to see the current default target and use `systemctl set-default` to set the desired default target.

### Booting Into a Specific Target 
- On theGrub 2 boot prompt, use `systemctl.unit=xxx.target` to boot into a specific target.

- To change between targets on a running system, use `systemctl isolate xxx.target`

# Working With GRUB2
The GRUB 2 boot loader makes sure that you can boot Linux. GRUB 2 is installed in the boot sector of your server’s hard drive and is configured to load a Linux kernel and the initramfs:

-   The kernel is the heart of the operating system, allowing users to interact with the hardware that is installed in the server.
-   The initramfs contains drivers that are needed to start your server. It contains a mini file system that is mounted during boot. In it are kernel modules that are needed during the rest of the boot process (for example, the LVM modules and SCSI modules for accessing disks that are not supported by default).



### Runtime Parameters
Use  the `-e` command

### Persistant Parameters
To apply changes to the GRUB 2 configuration, the starting point is the `/etc/default/grub` file, which has options that tell GRUB what to do and how to do it. After writing changes, use one of the following commands:
- `grub2-mkconfig -o /boot/grub2/grub.cfg`
- `grub2-mkconfig -o /boot/efi/EFI/redhat/grub.cfg`
