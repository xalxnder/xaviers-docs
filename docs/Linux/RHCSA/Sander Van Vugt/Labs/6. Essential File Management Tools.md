1. Use tar to create a compressed archive of all files in the /etc and /opt directories. Write this archive to your home directory
2. Create a symbolic link to the archive you've just created in the /tmp directory
3. Remove the archive from your home directory. What happens to the symbolic link?





1. `tar -cvf lab.tar /etc /opt ; gzip lab.tar
	1. Shorter Version - `tar -czvf lab.tar /etc /opt 
2. `ln -s /root/lab.tar.gz .
3. The link dies :(
