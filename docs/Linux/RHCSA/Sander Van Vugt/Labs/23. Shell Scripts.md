1. Write a script that makes a copy of each file that has the \*. txt extension. The copy should be named filename.txt.bak. After making the copy, the script should move it to the /tmp directory 
2. While running the script, the directory where it should look for the files should be provided as an argument 
3. If no argument was provided, the script should stop with exit code 9









				
	```bash
	#!/bin/bash
	
if [ -z $1 ]
then
	echo You need a directory as an argument.
	exit 9
fi

for i in $1/*.txt
do
	cp $i $i.bak
	mv $i.bak /tmp
done
```
