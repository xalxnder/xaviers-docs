# Key Based Authentication

Passwords are great, but even the strongest can be guessed. With `ssh-keygen` two keys are created.
1. Private Key - This is like your identity. NEVER SHARE THIS
2. Public Key - This is copied to the server you're trying to access

When a user or process requests a connection to the remote server using the SSH client, a challenge-response sequence is initiated to complete authentication. The SSH server recognizes that a connection is being requested and sends an encrypted challenge request using the shared public key information. The SSH client then decrypts the challenge message and responds back to the server. The user or process must respond correctly to the challenge to be granted access. This [challenge-response](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Challenge-response_authentication) sequence happens automatically between the SSH client and server without any manual action by the user.


### How To
1. `ssh-keygen`
2. `ssh-copy-id {host/ip address}`
