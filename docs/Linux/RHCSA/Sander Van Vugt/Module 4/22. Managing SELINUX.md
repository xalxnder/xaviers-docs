# The Need for SELinux
Linux is built on Unix security.  Unix security consists of different solutions that were never developed with current IT security needs in mind. SELinux provides a complete and mandatory security solution. The basic principle is that if it isn't specifically allowed, IT WILL BE DENIED.

# SELinux Modes
SELinux is enabled and disabled at the kernel level. This means to switch between off and on, you need to reboot your system. There is a trouble shooting mode, so if it is enabled, you can either set to `enforcing` or `permissive`. Permissive does logging, but it doesn't block anything. Great for troubleshooting. `getenforce` shows the current state. To switch between these two states, use the `setenforce` command. Edit `/etc/sysconfig/selinux` to manage the default state of SELinux. On the exam, DO NOT set it to `disabled`. 

# Context Labels and Booleans
Context settings are an important part of SELinux operations. The context is a label that can be applied to different objects. Context labels define the nature of the object, and SELinux rules are created to match context labels of source objects to the context labels of target objects.
To see current context settings on the objects in the previous bulleted list, many commands offer support for the `-Z` option. For example, `ls -Z`
Every context label always consists of three different parts:
1. User
2. Role 
3. Type - This is all we care about for the exam.

### Setting Context Label
- Use `semanage fcontext`
	- To enforce the policy, use `restorecon`.

# SELinux Log Messages
- SELinux uses `auditd` to write log messages. 
- Ensure `sealert` is available/enabled.
	- `sealert`

# Troubleshooting

Oh no! Apache isn't working.

1. Turn off SELinux, and then try to start apache again. 
	1.` setenforce 0`
	2. `systemctl start httpd`
3. Ok, it's working so it must be an SELinux issue. 
4. `grep sealert /var/log/messages `
	1. ![[Pasted image 20220825060631.png]]
5. Run the sealert command from the log messages
6. It's literally telling you what command to run:
	1. ![[Pasted image 20220825060844.png]]
7. `semanage port -a -t http_port_t -p tcp 83`
8. `setenforce 1 to turn SELinux back on`
9. `systemctl stop httpd; systemctl start httpd`
10. `systemctl status httpd`
