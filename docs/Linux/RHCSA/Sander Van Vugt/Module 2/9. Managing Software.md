# Managing Software Packages With Yum
### Specifying Which Repo To Use

## Creating Your Own Repo

1. MAKE SURE YOUR DISC IS ACTUALLY LOADED
2. `dd if=/dev/sr0 of=/rhel9.iso bs=1M`
	1. substitute the 9 with whatever version of RHEL youre using.
3. `mkdir /repo`
4. vim /etc/fstab
	1. Add the following line:
		1. /rhel9.iso              /repo                   iso9660 defaults        0 0
5. `systemctl daemon-reload`
6. `mount -a`
7. Create two files
	1. `/etc/yum.repos.d/appstream.repo`
	2. `/etc/yum.repos.d/base.repo`

```bash
[appstream]
name=appstream
baseurl=file:///repo/AppStream
gpgcheck=0       
```


```bash
[base]
name=base
baseurl=file:///repo/BaseOS
gpgcheck=0
```
To tell your server which repository to use, you need to create a file with a name that ends in .repo in the directory /etc/yum.repos.d. In that file you need the following contents

- `[label] `The .repo file can contain different repositories, each section starting with a label that identifies the specific repository.
- `name= ` - Use this to specify the name of the repository you want to use.
- `baseurl=` - This option contains the URL that points to the specific repository location.

# Managing Package Module Streams
In RHEL, different versions of the same package can be offered using **Package Module Streams**. To separate core operating system packages from user-space packages, RHEL 8 provides two main repositories, referenced earlier: BaseOS and Application Stream. In BaseOS you’ll find core operating system packages as RPM packages. The life cycle of these packages is comparable to the life cycle of previous RHEL versions

### Understanding Modules

A module describes a set of RPM packages that belong together. Each module can have one or more application stream. A stream contains one specific version, and updates are provided for a specific stream.  Only one stream can be enabled at a time. Modules can also have more that one profile. A profile is al ist of packages that are installed together for a particular use case.

| ------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| RPM                | The default package format. Contains files, as well as metadata that describes how to install the files. Optionally may contain pre- and post-installation scripts as well. |
| Module             | A delivery mechanism to install RPM packages. In a module different versions and profiles can be provided.                                                                  |
| Application stream | A specific version of the module.                                                                                                                                           |
|      Profile              |                      A collection of packages that are installed together for a particular use case                                                                                                                                                       |



### Managing Modules

The `yum module` command is used to manage module properties. To get an idea of what modules are available, run `yum module list`. After you find out what module streams are available, run `yum module info`. Once you have the info you need, the next step is to enable a module stream and install modules. To use a specific version, you'd run something like `yum module enable perl 5.24` . If, for instance, you are now on php:7.1 and you want to change to php:7.2, you just have to type `yum module install php:7.2`. This will disable the old stream and enable the new stream. After doing this, to ensure that all dependent packages that are not in the module itself are updated as well, you should type `yum distro-sync` to finalize the procedure.

# Managing Software Packages with RPM 

Before repos, people used RPM. But this wasn't good with handling dependencies, so don't use it anymore. 


### RPM Filenames
When you’re working with RPM packages directly, it makes sense to understand how the RPM filename is composed. A typical RPM filename looks like `autofs-5.0.7-40.el7.x86_64.rpm`. This name consists of several parts:


- `autofs`: The name of the actual package.
- `5.0.7`: The version of the package. This normally corresponds to the name of the package as it was released by the package creator
- `-40`: The subversion of the package.
- `el7`: The Red Hat version this package was created for.
-` x86_64`: The platform (32 bits or 64 bits) this package was created for.

### Querying the RPM Database

The rpm command enables you to get much information about packages. Using RPM queries can be a really useful way to find out how software can be configured and used. 

>[!TIP] RPM queries by default are used on the RPM database, and what you are querying are installed RPM packages. It sometimes makes sense to query an RPM package file before actually installing it. To do this, you need to add the -p option to the query, because without the -p option, you will be querying the database, not the package file.


| Command          | Use                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| ---------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| rpm -qf          | Uses a filename as its argument to find the specific RPM package a file belongs to.                                                                                                                                                                      |
| rpm -ql          | Uses the RPM database to provide a list of files in the RPM package.                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| rpm -qi          | Uses the RPM database to provide package information (equivalent to yum info).                                                                                                                                                                           |
| rpm -qd          | Uses the RPM database to show all documentation that is available in the package.                                                                                                                                                                        |
| rpm -qc          | Uses the RPM database to show all configuration files that are available in the package.                                                                                                                                                                 |
| rpm -q --scripts | Uses the RPM database to show scripts that are used in the package. This is particularly useful if combined with the -p option.                                                                                                                          |
| rpm -qp \<pkg\>  | The -p option is used with all the previously listed options to query individual RPM package files instead of the RPM package database. Using this option before installation helps you find out what is actually in the package before it is installed. |
| rpm -qR          | Shows dependencies for a specific package.                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| rpm -V           | Shows which parts of a specific package have been changed since installation.                                                                                                                                                                            |
| rpm -Va                 |           Verifies all installed packages and shows which parts of the package have been changed since installation. This is an easy and convenient way[…]                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
