# LVM
Logical Volume Manager allows you to dynamically grow a partition when it is running out of space. 

### Architecture 
![[Pasted image 20220815191553.png|1000 ]]


### LVM Features 
- LVM offers a flexible solution for managing storage. Volumes are no longer bound to the restrictions of physical hard drives. 
- Snapshots, which are essential to backup strategies.
- The ability to replace failing hardware easily. 
	- If a hard disk is failing, data can be moved within the volume group (through the `pvmove` command), the failing disk can then be removed from the volume group, and a new hard disk can be added dynamically, without requiring any downtime for the logical volume itself.

### Extents
Extents are the elementary blocks of LVM allocation. The extent size can be defined while defining the volume group. For example `vgcreate -s 8M vgdata /dev/sdb1`. This creates a volume group with an extent size of 8MB. All of the LVM logical volumes built from this volume group will use the **same extent size**. You can use `vgdisplay` to check the extent size. Look for `PE Size`. You can also check how many extents with the `lvdisplay` command. Just look for `Current LE`

#### Extent Amount
`lvcreate -l 

#### LVM Size
`lvcreate -L`

#### Extent Size
`vgcreate -s

# Creating Logical Volumes
Creating logical volumes involves creating 3 layers in the LVM architecture:
1. Convert physical devices into physical volumes
2. Create the volume group and assign PVs to it.
3. Create the logical volume itself. 
>[!TIP] For the exam, you must memorize pv, vg, and lv. Remember though, use tab to see their options. 


### Create The Partition
1. `parted /dev/{deviceName}`
2. It will ask for a partition table
	1. msdos or gpt

3. `mkpart`
4. It will ask for a partition name:
	1. Set it to `lvm1`
5. File System Type
	1. Just press `enter`
6. Set the start point
7. Set the end point
8. Verify with `print`
9. From the print command, get the number of the partition and type `set {number} lvm on`
10. `quit`

### Create The Physical Volume
1. `pvcreate /dev/{partition}`
	1. You should receive a success message
![[Pasted image 20220902124439.png]]

### Create The Volume Group
1. `vgcreate vgdata /dev/{partition}`
	1. Again, you should receive a success message
![[Pasted image 20220902124506.png]]

### Create The Logical Volume
1. `lvcreate -n lvdata -L 812M vgdata`
![[Pasted image 20220902124540.png]]
### Putting Filesystem on the Logical Volume
1. mkfs.xfs /dev/vgdata/lvdata 
![[Pasted image 20220902124614.png]]
### Mount it in FSTAB
1. Create your mount point
	1. mkdir /mounts/lvm1
2. vim /etc/fstab
	1. ![[Pasted image 20220902055615.png]]
3. mount -a
4. Reboot!




# Resizing LVM Logical Volumes

To increase the size of a logical volume, you need to have disk space available in the volume group, so we address that first.

>[!TIP] The size of an XFS file system cannot be decreased; it can only be increased. If you need a file system that can be shrunk in size, use Ext4, not XFS.

## Resizing Volume Groups
The `vgextend` command is used to add storage to a volume group, and the `vgreduce` command is used to take physical volumes out of a volume group. For the exam, you WILL need to know how to extend. Here are the steps:
1. Make sure that a physical volume or device is available to be added to the volume group.
2. Use `vgextend` to extend the volume group. The new disk space will show immediately in the volume group.
3. Verify everything with the `vgs` command. 


## Resizing Logical Volumes and File Systems

Logical volumes can be extended with the `lvextend` command. This command has a very useful option -r to take care of extending the file systems on the logical volume at the same time; it is recommended to use this option and not the alternative approach that separately extends the logical volumes and the file systems on top of the logical volumes. The easiest and most intuitive way to do that is by using -L followed by a + sign and the amount of disk space you want to add, as in `lvresize -L +1G -r /dev/vgdata/lvdata`.
