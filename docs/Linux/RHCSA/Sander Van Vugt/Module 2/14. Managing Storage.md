# Storage Options Overview
- Partitions- The classic solution. Used the majority of the time.
- LVM - Used as default installation of RHEL
	- Adds flexibility to storage (resize, snapshots, and more)
- Statis
	- Next Gen volume managing filesystem that uses thin provisioning by default.
- VDO (Virtual Data Optimizer)
	- Focused on storing files in the most efficient way. 
	- Manages deduplicated and compressed storage pools.

# MBR and GPT Partitions

### Master Boot Record (MBR)
-   MBR is a special type of boot sector at the very beginning of partitioned computer mass storage devices like fixed disks or removable drives that holds the information on how the logical partitions, containing file systems, are organized on that medium.
-   This MBR code is usually referred to as a boot loader.
-   It is the first sector of the Hard Disk with a size of 512 bytes.
-   The first 434 - 446 bytes are the primary boot loader, 64 bytes for partition table and 6 bytes for MBR validation timestamp.
-   The Partition Table, located in the master boot record, contains 16-byte entries, each of which describes a partition.
-   The organization of the partition table in the MBR limits the maximum addressable storage space of a disk to 2 TB (232 × 512 bytes)


### GUID Partition Table (GPT)
On computers that are using the new Unified Extensible Firmware Interface (UEFI) as a replacement for the old BIOS system, GPT partitions are the only way to address disks. Also, older computer systems that are using BIOS instead of UEFI can be configured with GUID partitions, which is necessary if a disk with a size bigger than 2 TiB needs to be addressed.

Benefits of GUID
-   The maximum partition size is 8 zebibyte (ZiB), which is 1024 × 1024 × 1024 × 1024 gibibytes.
-   In GPT, up to a maximum number of 128 partitions can be created.
-   The 2-TiB limit no longer exists.
-   Because space that is available to store partitions is much bigger than 64 bytes, which was used in MBR, there is no longer a need to distinguish between primary, extended, and logical partitions.
-   GPT uses a 128-bit global unique ID (GUID) to identify partitions.
-   A backup copy of the GUID partition table is created by default at the end of the disk, which eliminates the single point of failure that exists on MBR partition tables.

#### Common Disk Device Types
| Device Name  | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| ------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `/dev/sda `    | A hard disk that uses the SCSI driver. Used for SCSI and SATA disk devices. Common on physical servers but also in VMware virtual machines.                                                                                                                       |
| `/dev/nvme0n1` | The first hard disk on an NVM Express (NVMe) interface. NVMe is a server-grade method to address advanced SSD devices. Note at the end of the device name that the first disk in this case is referred to as n1 instead of a (as is common with the other types). |
| `/dev/hda`     | Legacy IDE disk device type                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
|` /dev/vda `    | A disk in a KVM virtual machine that uses the virtio disk driver. This is the common disk device type for KVM virtual machines.                                                                                                                                   |
| `/dev/xvda `            |   A disk in a Xen virtual machine that uses the Xen virtual disk driver. You see this when installing RHEL as a virtual machine in Xen virtualization. RHEL 8 cannot be used as a Xen hypervisor, but you might see RHEL 8 virtual machines on top of the Xen hypervisor using these disk types.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |

>[!TIP] Almost all disk device names end with the letter a. The reason is that it is the first disk that was found in your server. The second SCSI disk, for instance, would have the name /dev/sdb etc...


# Using Extended and Logical Partitions on MBR
If three partitions have been created already, there is room for one more primary partition, after which the partition table is completely filled up. If you want to go beyond four partitions on an MBR disk, you have to create an extended partition. Following that, you can create logical partitions within the extended partition.
>[!WARNING]  An extended partition is used only for the purpose of creating logical partitions. You cannot create file systems directly on an extended partition!

### Creating Logical Partitions

1.  In a root shell, type fdisk /dev/sda to open the fdisk interface.
2.  To create a logical partition, when fdisk prompts which partition type you want to create, enter e.  
3. If the extended partition is the fourth partition that you are writing to the MBR, it will also be the last partition that can be added to the MBR. For that reason,  
it should fill the rest of your computer’s hard disk. Press Enter to accept the default first sector and press Enter again when fdisk prompts for the last sector. Note that this extended partition should use the rest of the remaining disk space, because all disk space not included in this partition cannot be allocated at a later stage.
4.  Now that the extended partition has been created, you can create a logical partition within it. Still from the fdisk interface, press n again. The utility will prompt that all primary partitions are in use now and by default suggest adding a logical partition with partition number 5.
5.  Press Enter to accept the default first sector. When asked for the last sector, enter +100M (or any other size you want to use).
6.  Now that the logical partition has been created, enter w to write the changes to disk and quit fdisk. To complete the procedure, enter `partprobe` to update the kernel partition table. The new partition is now ready for use. If part- probe responds with an error message, you should reboot your system before continuing.



# File Systems
Partitions are useless unless you're doing something with them. This is where file systems come in to play. Once you make a filesystem, you mount it.

#### File System Overview
| File System | Description          |
| ----------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| XFS         | The default file system in RHEL 8. Fast and Scalable. Uses CoW for data integrity. Size can be increased, NOT decreased.                                                                                          |
| Ext4        | The default file system in previous versions of RHEL; still available and supported in RHEL 8.    Backward compatible to Ext2. Uses Journaling for data integrity. Size can be increased, AND decreased                          |
| BtrFS       | A relatively new file system that is not supported in RHEL 8.                                                               |

Use `mkfs -t` to format a partition with one of the above file systems. 

>[!WARNING] Never just type mkfs. This will create an Ext2 file system, and theres no need for that anymore. 

## Changing File System Properties
When working with file systems, you can manage some properties as well. File system properties are specific for the file system you are using, so you work with different properties and different tools for the different file systems.

### Ext4
The generic tool for managing Ext4 file system properties is `tune2fs`.
### XFS
`xfs_admin`

# Creating Swap Partition 
1.  Type `parted {device}`, which will bring you to interactive shell.
2.  `mkpart`, which will ask you for a name. just call it **swap**
3.  File System type should be `linux-swap`!!!
4.  Start - 1GiB
5. End - 2GiB
6. `quit`
7. `mkswap` {device name}
8.  Type free -m. You see the amount of swap space that is currently allocated. This does not include the swap space you have just created, as it still needs to be activated.
9.  Use `swapon` to switch on the newly allocated swap space. If, for instance, the swap device you have just created is /dev/sda6, use swapon /dev/sda6 to activate the swap space.
10.  Type free -m again. You see that the new swap space has been added to your server.


### Adding Swap Files

If you do not have free disk space to create a swap partition and you do need to add swap space urgently, you can use a swap file as well. From a performance perspective, it does not even make that much difference if a swap file is used instead of a swap device such as a partition or a logical volume, and it may help you fulfill an urgent need in a timely manner.

To add a swap file, you need to create the file first. The dd if=/dev/zero of=/ swapfile bs=1M count=100 command would add 100 blocks with a size of 1 MiB from the /dev/zero device (which generates 0s) to the /swapfile file. The result is a 100-MiB file that can be configured as swap. To do so, you can follow the same procedure as for swap partitions. First use mkswap /swapfile to mark the file as a swap file, and then use swapon /swapfile to activate it.

# Mounting File Systems
To use a partition, you actually need to **mount** it. By mounting it, you make its contents accessible through a specific directory.  To mount a filesystem, we need to know:
- What to mount
- Where to mount it
- What file system to mount
- Mount options


### How To Mount a Filesystem Manually
>[!TIP] The /mnt directory can be used to test mounts. 


```bash
# Mount the filesystem on /dev/sda5 on the /mnt directory
mount /dev/sda5 /mnt

#Mount using UUID
mount UUID="42f419c4-633f-4ed7-b161-519a4dadd3da" /mnt

#Unmount. You can either use the device name or mount point
umount /dev/sda5 
```

### Mounting Automatically Through fstab
1.  From a root shell, type `blkid`. Use the mouse to copy the UUID="nnnn" part for /dev/sda5.
2.  Type mkdir -p /mounts/data to create a mount point for this partition.
3.  Open /etc/fstab in an editor and add the following line: UUID="nnnn" /mounts/data xfs defaults 1 2
4.  Before you attempt an automatic mount while rebooting, it is a good idea to test the configuration. Type mount -a. This command mounts everything that is specified in /etc/fstab and that has not been mounted already.
5.  Type df -h to verify that the partition has been mounted correctly.

![[Pasted image 20220817065549.png]]
1. Once you add your newly created partitions, save your changes.
2. Make your corresponding directories. For this example, those were /xfs and /ext4
3. Then run `systemctl daemon-reload`
4. Then run `mount -a`

### Note on Naming
In fstab in the first column, don't use the device name. Instead use its UUID or create a label for it. Why? Because `/dev/nvme0n3p1` could change. Might not, but it could.
To use the UUID:
- Use the `blkid` command, then in fstab, you'd use UID={ID}. 
To create your own label:
- Use `tune2fs -L {NAME} {DEVICE}`
	- `tune2fs -L TEST /dev/nvme0n3p1`
- If the filesystem is XFS, use `xfs_admin -L`
