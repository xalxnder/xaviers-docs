| Command | Explanation                                                    |
| ------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `less`    | Opens the text file in a pager, which allows for easy reading  |
| `cat`     | Dumps the contents of the text file on the screen              |
| `head`    | Shows the first ten lines of the text file                     |
| `tail`    | Shows the last ten lines                                       |
| `cut`     | Used to filter specific columns or characters from a text file |
| `sort`    | Sorts the contents of a text file                              |
| `wc`      | Counts the number of lines, words, and characters in a file    |

## Cut
When youâ€™re working with text files, it can be useful to filter out specific fields. Imagine that you need to see a list of all users in the /etc/passwd file. In this file, several fields are defined, of which the first contains the name of the users who are defined.

### Command Anatomy 
- d - Used to define the delimiter


To display the first field of the `/etc/passwd` file, run `cut -d : -f 1 /etc/ passwd`

## Sort
By default, sort sorts in byte order. So an uppercase Zoo, would appear before lowercase apple This is not always helpful.
- n - Sort in numeric order 
- r - Reverse sort 
- f - Ignore case. This will override sort's default byte sorting. 

# Regex

>[!WARNING] Regular expressions and Globbing are NOT the same. Regular expressions are used to look for contents of files, and globbing is used to find filenames.

>[!TIP] Make sure to surround your regular expression in single quotes.



| Expression | Usage                                                                      |
| ---------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `\^text     `| Matches **line** that starts with specified text.                              |
| `text$  `    | Matches **line** that ends with specified text.                                |
| .          | Wildcard. (Matches any single character.)                                  |
| `\[abc\] `   | Matches a, b, or c.                                                        |
| *          | Matches zero to an infinite number of the previous character.              |
| `\\{2\\} `   | Matches exactly two of the previous character.                             |
| `\\{1,3\\} ` | Matches a minimum of one and a maximum of three of the previous character. |
| `colou?r     `      |              Matches zero or one of the previous character. This makes the previous character optional, which in this example would match both color and colour.                                                              |

## Examples
``"/web(/.*)?"

In this regular expression, the text /web is referred to. This text string can be followed by the regular expression (/.*)?, which means zero or one (/.*), which in fact means that it can be followed by nothing or (/.*). The (/.*) refers to a slash, which may be followed by an unlimited number of characters. To state it differently, the regular expression refers to the text /web, which may or may not be followed by any characters.
`r.t ` would match the strings rat, rot, and rut.
`r[aou]t` matches the strings rat, rot, and rut.
`re\{2\}d,`  would match reed, but not red.

## Grep
This is the ultimate utility to use WITH regex
>[!TIP] When using grep with regular expression, wrap the regex in quotes.


| Option        | Use                                                               |
| ------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| -i            | Not case sensitive. Matches upper- and lowercase letters.         |
| -v            | Shows only lines that do not contain the regular expression.      |
| -r            | Searches files in the current directory and all subdirectories.   |
| -e            | Searches for lines matching more than one regular expression.     |
| -A \<number\> | Shows \<number\> of lines after the matching regular expression.  |
| -B \<number\> | Shows \<number\> of lines before the matching regular expression. |
| -l            | Show ONLY matching filenames, and not the contents                                                                  |
### Examples
```bash
# Display all lines containing the string bash in /etc/passwd
grep bash /etc/passwd

#Display the lines that do NOT contain the string 'nologin'
grep -v nologin /etc/passwd

#Search for the string 'linuxize.com' in all files inside the /etc/directory
grep -r 'linuxize.com' /etc

#Searh for the string linux at the beginning of the line in file.txt
grep '^linux' file.txt

```

# Lab
1.  Describe two ways to show line 5 from the /etc/passwd file.
	1. sed
	2. head, then tail
2.  How would you locate all text files on your server that contain the current IP address? Do you need a regular expression to do this?
	1. `grep -rs '192.168.213.129' *`
3.  You have just used the sed command that replaces all occurrences of the text `Administrator` with `root`. Your Windows administrators do not like that very much. How do you revert?
	1. ``sed -i s/root/Administrator/g ~/myfile``
4.  Assuming that in the `ps aux` command the fifth field contains information about memory utilization, how would you process the output of that command to show the process that has the heaviest memory utilization first in the results list?
	1. `ps aux --sort -%mem`
	2. `ps aux | sort -rk4`
5.  Which command enables you to filter the sixth column of ps aux output?
	1. `ps aux |awk '{print $6}'`
6.  How do you delete the sixth line from the file `~/myfile`?
	1. `sed '5d' myfile`
7. Use `sed` to display the fifth line of the file `/etc/passwd`.
	1. `sed -n 5p /etc/passwd`
8. Use `awk` in a pipe to filter the last column out of the results of the ps aux command
	1. `ps aux |awk '{print $(NF)}'`
9. Use `grep` to show the names of all files in `/etc` that have lines containing the text root as a word. 
	1. `grep '\<root\>' * 2>/dev/null`
10. Use `grep` to show all lines from all files in `/etc` that contain exactly 3 characters.
	1. `grep '^...$' * 2>/dev/null`
11. Use `grep` to find all files that contain the string "alex", but make sure that "alexander" is not included in the result. 
	1. `grep '^alex$' *`
