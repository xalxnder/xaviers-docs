# File System Hierarchy 
- /  - Specifies the root directory. This is where the file system tree starts.
- /boot - Contains all files and directories that are needed to boot the Linux kernel.
- /dev - Contains device files that are used for accessing physical devices. This directory is essential during boot.
- /etc - Contains configuration files that are used by programs and services on your server. This directory is essential during boot.
- /home - Used for local user home directories.
- /media, /mnt - Contain directories that are used for mounting devices in the file system tree.
- /opt - Used for optional packages that may be installed on your server.
- /proc - Used by the proc file system. This is a file system structure that gives access to kernel information.
- /root - Specifies the home directory of the root user.
- /run - Contains process and user-specific information that has been created since the last boot.
- /srv - May be used for data by services like NFS, FTP, and HTTP.
- /sys - Used as an interface to different hardware devices that are managed by the Linux kernel and associated processes.

## Finding Files
#### Locate
If you're going to use this, make sure you have a cron job set up to update the database manually
#### Find
One of the most powerful tools in Linux. You can use the `find` command to search for files and directories based on their permissions, type, date, ownership, size, and more.
```bash
# Search for a file named `document.pdf` in the `/home/linuxize` directory
find /home/linuxize -type f -name document.pdf
```

The `exec` option lets us run commands on whatever file we just found.
```bash
# Search for a file named `document.pdf` in the `/home/linuxize` directory, and then change its permissions. 
find /home/linuxize -type f -name document.pdf -exec chmod 0755 {} \;
```
The `{}` is the results placeholder, and the ``;`` is the delimiter. The `\` is just used to escape it 


## Mounts
Linux file system is presented as one hierarchy, with the root directory (/) as its starting point. This hierarchy may be distributed over dif- ferent devices and even computer systems that are mounted into the root directory.

In the process of mounting, a device is connected to a specific directory, such that after a successful mount this directory gives access to the device contents.

The **mount** command gives an overview of all mounted devices. To get this information, the /proc/mounts file is read, where the kernel keeps information about all current mounts. It shows kernel interfaces also, which may lead to a long list of mounted devices being displayed.

- df -Th  -   The -h option summarizes the output of the command in a human-readable way, and the -T option shows which file system type is used on the different mounts.

-   **findmnt** -  shows mounts and the relationship that exists between the different mounts. This has a more readable output than **mount**
-
```bash
[root@rhcsa9 ~]# findmnt

# Managing Files
## Wildcards 

* Asterisk * - Refers to an unlimited number of any characters.` ls *` , for instance, shows all files in the current directory (except those that have a name starting with a dot).
	* STARTS WITH - abc*
	* ENDS WITH - \*abc
	* CONTAINING - \*abc\*
	
- Question Mark? - Used to refer to one specific character that can be any character. `ls c?t` would match cat as well as cut.
- \[auo\] - Refers to one character that may be selected from the range that is specified between square brackets. `ls c\[auo\]t` would match cat, cut, and cot.

## Absolute vs Relative Pathnames

An **absolute** filename, or absolute pathname, is a complete path reference to the file or directory you want to work with. This pathname starts with the root directory, followed by all subdirectories up to the actual filename. No matter what your current  
directory is, absolute filenames will always work. An example of an absolute filename is /home/lisa/file1.

A **relative** filename is relative to the current directory as shown with the pwd command. It contains only the elements that are required to get from the current directory up to the item you need. Suppose that your current directory is /home (as shown by the pwd command). When you refer to the relative filename lisa/file1, you are referring to the absolute filename /home/lisa/file1.

## Listing Files and Directories

| Command | Use                                                                                                                                      |
| ------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| ls -l   | Shows a long listing, which includes information about file properties, such as creation date and permissions.                           |
| ls -a   | Shows all files, including hidden files.                                                                                                 |
| ls -lrt | Shows commands sorted on modification date. You’ll see the most recently modified files last in the list. This is a very useful command. |
| ls -d   | Shows the names of directories, not the contents of all directories that match the wildcards that have been used with the ls command.    |
| ls -R   | Shows the contents of the current directory, in addition to all of its subdirectories; that is, it Recursively descends all subdirectories.                                                                                                                                         |


## Copying Files and Directories
Use `-a `with cp to keep all current permissions. So, to copy an exact state of your home directory and everything within it to the /tmp directory, use **cp -a ~ /tmp.**

A special case when working with cp is hidden files. By default, hidden files are not copied over. There are three solutions to copy hidden files as well:
- `cp /somedir/.* /tmp
- `cp -a /somedir/ .
- `cp -a /somedir/. .`



## Links

### Hard Links

Linux stores administrative data about files in inodes. The inode is used to store all administrative data about files. Every file on Linux has an inode, and in the inode, important information about the file is stored.  It is interesting to know that an inode does not know which name it has; it just knows how many names are associated with the inode. These names are referred to as hard links.

A file is just a collection of blocks. Every file has its own iNode, and every iNode has its own number. The filename is what points to this iNode. The symbolic link knows nothing about the iNode. It actually gets its own. 


![[Links.drawio.png]]
#### Symbolic Links
A symbolic link (also referred to as soft link) does not link directly to the inode but to the name of the file. This makes symbolic links much more flexible, but it also has some disadvantages. The advantage of symbolic links is that they can link to files on other devices, as well as on directories. The major disadvantage is that when the original file is removed, the symbolic link becomes invalid and does not work any longer.

##### Creating Links
| Command            | Explanation                                                             |
| ------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| ln /etc/hosts .    | Creates a link to the file /etc/hosts in the current directory          |
| ln -s /etc/hosts . | Creates a symbolic link to the file /etc/hosts in the current directory |
| ln -s /home /tmp   | Creates a symbolic link to the directory /home in the directory /tmp                                                                        |

## Archiving and Compression

	ARCHIVING AND COMPRESSING ARE NOT THE SAME THING

### Archiving with Tar
To create an archive, you use `tar -cf flename.tar files-you-want-to-archive` . To see whats happening, use the `-v` option. To use tar, you must at least have read permissions. 
To add a file to an archive, use the `-r` option. To update an existing archived file, use `-u`.  So, use  `tar -uvf /root/homes.tar /home` to write newer versions of all files in /home to the archive. To see the contents of an archive, sue `-t`, so `tar -tvf /root/homes.tar` to see the contents of the tar archive.
To extract the contents of an archive, use `tar -xvf /archivename.tar`. This extracts the archive in the current directory. This might not be what you want. To get around this, you can :
1. cd to a new directory 
2. Use the `-C /targetdir` option. 
	1. `` tar -xvf homes.tar -C /tmp 
To extract a single file, use `tar -xvf /archivename.tar file-you-want-to-extract`

> For tar, ORDER matters. The -f flag must come last because it is expecting a file name. 


| Option | Use                                                                   |
| ------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| c      | Creates an archive.                                                   |
| v      | Shows verbose output while tar is working.                            |
| t      | Shows the contents of an archive.                                     |
| z      | Compresses/decompresses the archive while creating it, by using gzip. |
| j      | Compresses/decompresses the archive by using bzip2.                   |
| x      | Extracts an archive.                                                  |
| u      | Updates an archive; only newer files will be written to the archive.  |
| C      | Changes the working directory before performing the command.          |
| r      | Appends files to an archive.                                                                      |

### Compression

To compress use gzip. To uncompress, use gunzip

# Lab
1.  Log is user root. In the home directory of root, create one archive file that contains the contents of the `/home` directory and the `/etc` directory. Use the name `/root/essentials.tar `for the archive
	1. `tar -cf essentials.tar /home /etc`
2.  Copy this archive to the /tmp directory. Also create a hard link to this file in the / directory.
	1. `cp essentials.tar /tmp`
	2. `ln /tmp/essentials.tar .`
3.  Rename the file `/essentials.tar` to `/archive.tar`.
	1. `mv essentials.tar archive.tar`
4.  Create a symbolic link in the home directory of the user root that refers to  /archive.tar. Use the name link.tar for the symbolic link.
	1. `ln -s /archive.tar`
6.  Compress the /root/essentials.tar file.
	1. `gzip essentials.tar`
7. Create a directory structure `/tmp/files/pictures`, `tmp/files/photos`, and `tmp/files/videos`
	1. `mkdir -p /tmp/files/{pictures,photos,videos}`
8. Copy all files that have a name starting with a,b,or c from /etc to /tmp/files
	1. `cd /etc`
	2. `cp -r [a-c]* /tmp/files/`
9. From /tmp/files, move all files that have a name starting with an a, or b to `tmp/files/photos`, and files starting with a c to `tmp/files/videos`
	1. `mv [a,b]* photos/`
	2. `mv c* videos/`
10. Find all files in `/etc` that have a size smaller than 1000 bytes and copy those to `tmp/files/pictures`
	1. `find /etc -type f -size -1000c -exec cp {} /tmp/files/pictures/  \;`
11. In `/tmp/files`, create a symbolic link to /var
	1. `ln -s /tmp/files`
12. Create a compressed archive file of the `/home directory`
	1. `tar -czvf home.tgz /home/`
13. Extract this compressed archive with relative file names in `/tmp/archive`
	1. `tar -xvf home.tar`
